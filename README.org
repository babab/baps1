* Benjamin A's PS1

  To use it as it was intended put the following in your ~PS1~ or
  ~PROMPT~ variable, depending on whether you use ~bash~ or ~zsh~:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  PS1="\$(/path/to/baps1)"
  #+END_SRC

  Or, if you like single quotes, use:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  PS1='$(/path/to/baps1)'
  #+END_SRC
