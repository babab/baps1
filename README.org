* Benjamin A's PS1

  baps1 is meant to be used in your shell prompt and shows the current
  tty and time since the last call to baps1 for that tty, which can give
  you a rough estimation of the time duration of the last command. It is
  basically like calling every command with ~time <command>~ (plus the
  time it took you to write out the command).

  Example output: ~p1:5m43s~

  To use it as it was intended put the following in your ~PS1~ or
  ~PROMPT~ variable, depending on whether you use ~bash~ or ~zsh~:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  PS1="\$(/path/to/baps1)"
  #+END_SRC

  Or, if you like single quotes, use:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  PS1='$(/path/to/baps1)'
  #+END_SRC
